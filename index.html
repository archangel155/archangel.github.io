<h3 style="color: greenyellow;">SENTENCES.—PARTS OF SPEECH.—ELEMENTS OF THE SENTENCE.—PHRASES AND 
CLAUSES</h3>
<h4 style="color:greenyellow">Sentences</h4>
<ul>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A sentence is a group of words that work together to express a 
complete thought or idea.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A declarative sentence is simply a sentence that states a fact or 
idea. It's like telling someone something or sharing information.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An imperative sentence is a sentence that gives a command or makes 
a request.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An interrogative sentence is simply a sentence that asks a 
question.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An exclamatory sentence is a sentence that expresses strong 
feelings or emotions. </li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color:greenyellow;">Parts Of Speech</h4>
<ul>
<li style="color:greenyellow;">A noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. </li>
<li style="color:greenyellow;">A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun (a person, 
place, or thing). It's like a shortcut so we don't have to keep repeating the same noun over and 
over again.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An adjective is a word that describes a noun. It gives us more 
information about the noun, like what it looks like, how it feels, or what kind it is.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">Substantive is another word for nouns and pronouns.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a 
noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence. It tells us where something is located, when 
something happened, or how something is done.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, or 
sentences together. It's like a glue that holds different parts of our language together.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An interjection is a word or a short phrase that expresses a 
sudden feeling or emotion.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An expletive is a word that doesn't really add any meaning to a 
sentence. It's like a placeholder that fills a spot but doesn't really do anything important.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color: greenyellow;">Elements Of The Sentence</h4>
<ul>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">The subject of a sentence is the person, place, thing, or 
idea that is doing something or being described. </li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">The predicate is the part of a sentence that tells us what the 
subject is doing or what is happening to the subject. It's like the action or description of the 
sentence.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">Simple subject/predicate: The basic building blocks of a 
sentence.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">Modified subject/predicate: Adding details and descriptions 
to make the sentence more interesting and informative.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">Compound subject: This is when a sentence has two or more 
subjects that share the same verb.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">Compound predicate: This is when a sentence has two or more 
verbs that share the same subject.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color: greenyellow;">Phrases and Clauses</h4>
<ul>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An attribute complement is a word or phrase that describes or 
renames the subject of a sentence. </li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An object complement is a word or phrase that describes or 
renames the direct object of a sentence. It usually follows the direct object and provides 
more information about it.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An adjective modifier is simply a word or group of words that 
describes or gives more information about a noun or pronoun.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">An adverbial modifier is a word or group of words that describes 
a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. It gives us more information about how, when, where, or 
why something happens.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">complement words are words or phrases that complete the meaning 
of a sentence.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">Copulative verbs, also known as linking verbs, are words that 
connect the subject of a sentence to a word or phrase that describes or identifies it. </li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A transitive verb is an action word that needs an object to 
complete its meaning. It's like a verb that has to "pass on" its action to something or 
someone else.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A phrase in English grammar is a group of words that work 
together but don't form a complete sentence.  It's like a little cluster of words that has a 
meaning but can't stand alone.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A prepositional phrase is a group of words that starts 
with a preposition and ends with a noun or pronoun. It acts like an adjective or an adverb, 
adding more information to the sentence.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A verb phrase is a group of words that work together to 
express an action or a state of being.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A clause in English grammar is a group of words that 
contains a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a verb (the action or 
state of being).</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A subordinate clause, also called a dependent clause, 
is like a sentence fragment.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A principal clause (also called an independent clause 
or main clause) is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and expresses a 
complete thought.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A substantive clause (also known as a noun clause) is a 
group of words that acts like a noun in a sentence. </li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A simple sentence is a sentence with only one 
independent clause.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A complex sentence is like a two-part story where one part can 
stand on its own, but the other part needs the first part to make sense.</li>
<li style="color: greenyellow;">A compound sentence is basically two or more simple sentences 
combined together. It's like taking two complete thoughts and joining them with a special word or 
punctuation mark.</li>
</ul>
