<h3 style="color: greenyellow;">Parts of Speech</h3>
<p style="color: greenyellow;">1. Noun is a word for the name of something. 2. Pronoun; a word 
used instead of a noun; as, I, he, it, that. Nouns, pronouns, or groups of words that are used as 
nouns or pronouns, are called by the general term, Substantives.3. Adjective; a word used to limit 
or qualify the meaning of a noun or a pronoun; as, good, five, tall, many. The words a, an, and 
the are words used to modify nouns or pronouns. They are adjectives, but are usually called 
Articles. 4. Verb; a word used to state something about some person or thing; as, do, see, think, 
make. 5. Adverb; a word used to modify the meaning of a verb, an adjective, or another adverb; 
as, very, slowly, clearly, often. 6. Preposition; a word used to join a substantive, as a 
modifier, to some other preceding word, and to show the relation of the substantive to that 
word; as, by, in, between, beyond. 7. Conjunction; a word used to connect words, phrases, clauses, 
and sentences; as, and, but, if, although, or. 8. Interjection; a word used to express surprise or 
emotion; as, Oh! Alas! Hurrah! Bah!</p>
<h3 style="color: greenyellow;">Elements Of The Sentence</h3>
<p style="color: greenyellow;">Sometimes a word adds nothing to the meaning of the sentence, 
but helps to fill out its form or sound, and serves as a device to alter its natural order. 
Such a word is called an Expletive. In the following sentence there is an expletive: There are no 
such books in print.</p>
<p style="color: greenyellow;">A sentence is made up of distinct parts or elements. The 
essential or Principal Elements are the Subject and the Predicate. The Subject of a sentence is 
the part which mentions that about which something is said. The Predicate is the part which states 
that which is said about the subject. Man walks. In this sentence, man is the subject, and walks 
is the predicate.</p>
<p style="color: greenyellow;">There may be, also, more than one subject connected with the 
same predicate; as, The man and the woman walk. This is called a Compound Subject. A Compound 
Predicate consists of more than one predicate used with the same subject; as, The man both walks 
and runs.</p>
<p style="color: greenyellow;">Besides the principal elements in a sentence, there are 
Subordinate Elements. These are the Attribute Complement, the Object Complement, 
the Adjective Modifier, and the Adverbial Modifier. Some verbs, to complete their sense, need 
to be followed by some other word or group of words. These words which "complement," or 
complete the meanings of verbs are called Complements. The Attribute Complement completes the 
meaning of the verb by stating some class, condition, or attribute of the subject; as, 
My friend is a student, I am well, The man is good Student, well, and good complete the 
meanings of their respective verbs, by stating some class, condition, or attribute of the 
subjects of the verbs. The attribute complement usually follows the verb be or its forms, is, 
are, was, will be, etc. The attribute complement is usually a noun, pronoun, or adjective, 
although it may be a phrase or clause fulfilling the function of any of these parts of speech. 
It must not be confused with an adverb or an adverbial modifier. In the sentence, He is there, 
there is an adverb, not an attribute complement. The verb used with an attribute complement, 
because such verb joins the subject to its attribute, is called the Copula ("to couple") or 
Copulative Verb. Some verbs require an object to complete their meaning. This object is called 
the Object Complement. In the sentence, I carry a book, the object, book, is required to 
complete the meaning of the transitive verb carry; so, also in the sentences, I hold the 
horse, and I touch a desk, the objects horse and desk are necessary to complete the meanings of 
their respective verbs. These verbs that require objects to complete their meaning are called 
Transitive Verbs. Adjective and Adverbial Modifiers may consist simply of adjectives and adverbs, 
or of phrases and clauses used as adjectives or adverbs.</p>
<h3 style="color: greenyellow;">Phrases and Clauses</h3>
<p style="color: greenyellow;">A Phrase is a group of words that is used as a single part of 
speech and that does not contain a subject and a predicate. A Prepositional Phrase, always used 
as either an adjective or an adverbial modifier, consists of a preposition with its object and 
the modifiers of the object; as, He lives in Pittsburg, Mr. Smith of this place is the manager of 
the mill, The letter is in the nearest desk. There are also Verb-phrases. A Verb-phrase is a 
phrase that serves as a verb; as, I am coming, He shall be told, He ought to have been told.</p>
<p style="color: greenyellow;">A Clause is a group of words containing a subject and a 
predicate; as, The man that I saw was tall. The clause, that I saw, contains both a subject, 
I, and a predicate, saw. This clause, since it merely states something of minor importance in the 
sentence, is called the Subordinate Clause. The Principal Clause, the one making the most 
important assertion, is, The man was tall. Clauses may be used as adjectives, as adverbs, and as 
nouns. A clause used as a noun is called a Substantive Clause. Examine the following examples:
Adjective Clause: The book that I want is a history. Adverbial Clause: He came when he had 
finished with the work. Noun Clause as subject: That I am here is true. Noun Clause as object: 
He said that I was mistaken.</p>
<p style="color: greenyellow;">Sentences, as to their composition, are classified as 
follows: Simple; a sentence consisting of a single statement; as, The man walks. Complex; a 
sentence consisting of one principal clause and one or more subordinate clauses; as, The man 
that I saw is tall. Compound; a sentence consisting of two or more clauses of equal importance 
connected by conjunctions expressed or understood; as, The man is tall and walks rapidly, and 
Watch the little things; they are important.</p>
